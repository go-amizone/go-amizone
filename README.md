**go-amizone** is a simple and robust Go library and API server for the [Amizone](https://s.amizone.net) student portal.
This library is intended to be used as a self-hosted Go API or as an SDK in your Go application.

## Inspiration

Amizone is _the_ student portal for [Amity University](https://www.amity.edu/). It's indispensable for students to
access their grades, attendance, class schedule and other information. The catch: it's buggy, slow and goes down all the
time! Students have made a slew of alternative apps and tools to access the portal over the years -- many of them mobile
apps, but also arguably better approaches like the excellent [monday-api][monday-api] bot by [@0xSaurabh][0xSaurabh]
(my initial inspiration!)

**But why go-amizone?** Because I wanted a simple, lean and robust API client for Amizone to develop an application
of my own and no existing solution seemed good enough. With this, I set out to develop something everyone (including me)
could use to build their own projects around the portal. While `go-amizone` is written in Go (_duh_), it has a WIP
OpenAPI documented API server which enables autogenerated SDKs for any language under the sun!

## Completeness

`go-amizone` is far from complete. While its completely possible to use in applications today, there are no
guarantees yet for a stable API, which will come around with the 1.0 stable release. In the coming weeks I'll be adding
more features to drive the library closer to covering a more complete range of the data and features the Amizone
portal exposes.

## Installation

The library can be installed either as an SDK to use in your own Go project or as a self-hosted API with the server
binary. With the latter, you would be able to use Swagger to generate SDKs for other languages in the near future.

### SDK

Install the library using `go get github.com/ditsuke/amizone-go`. The public API is well documented through godocs,
easily accessed on [pkg.go.dev][go-reference] or [godocs.io][godocs.io].

### API Server

The API Server offers a RESTful API through a single Go binary. It is intended to be used self-hosted on a VPS or a PaaS
like [Heroku][heroku], but I'll have a central deployment up soon so everyone can try out! To try locally, run:

```shell
go install github.com/ditsuke/go-amizone/cmd/amizone-api-server@latest # installs the binary
amizone-api-server # runs the server
```

A docker image will be made available soon to make deployments easier.

## Contributing

Contributions to go-amizone are welcome! If you have a bug or feature request, please open an issue on the
[GitHub repo][github]. Code contributions should be a great way to get started with Go development and learn
about the language, reverse-engineering, and other cool stuff.

Please read the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get started.
